FleaMarket, A campus market place.

## Project Overview

FLEAMARKET is a college-centric mobile app fostering the buying and selling of used items. Users easily list products with photos and details, while a streamlined interface enables
seamless browsing. With Firebase for secure authentication and data storage, FLEAMARKET features real-time in-app chat for negotiations, a wishlist for tracking interests, and a
transaction model that empowers users to finalize deals offline. Prioritizing user privacy, the platform acts as a middleman, connecting buyers and sellers. FLEAMARKET streamlines the
college trading experience, promoting sustainability and community engagement through a user-friendly, secure, and efficient marketplace.

FLEAMARKET's goals are to streamline college students' buying and selling experiences by offering an intuitive platform. Prioritizing
sustainability, the app promotes the reuse of items within the college community. It aims to enhance user satisfaction through a user-friendly
interface, real-time chat, and a wishlist feature. Security measures ensure the privacy of users, and acting as a trusted middleman, FLEAMARKET
connects buyers and sellers, fostering a dynamic marketplace community focused on sustainable consumption and efficient transactions.
